## What is this ?

Create V3 App is a CLI tool to generate a starter kit for a Nuxt Application. It is very heavily inspired by the [**T3 Stack**](https://create.t3.gg). It actually started as a direct port but was then tweaked to reflect my own beliefs and experiences about full stack web development.

The core pieces are [**Nuxt**](https://nuxt.com/) and [**TypeScript**](https://typescriptlang.org/). The setup of your back end logic is bootstrapped by using [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io/), [**Prisma**](https://prisma.io/), and [**Auth.js**](https://authjs.dev/). The styling and implementation of your design system made super easy by the excellent CSS Variables theme from [**Open Props**](https://open-props.style/). Internationalization is also made a breeze with the setup of [**Vue-i18n**](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/)

### So... what is create-V3-app? A template?

<img src="/images/yes.jpg" class="image--small" />

Yes. This is not a stack. This is not a framework. This is not a meta framework. This is just a starter kit to help getting you started immediately. Nothing more, nothing less.

### Will you add more libraries ?

An _Ultra Deluxe Enterprise Editionâ„¢_ version of this template will be available in the future, with a lot more opinionated choices, and batteries included features to allow you to focus on business logic without having to reinvent the wheel. However, I want to keep this lightweight version as well, first as a nod to the original goal of the T3 stack, and secondly because not all projects need the whole bells and whistles of a complex applications.

### Can I choose what I install like in `create-t3-app` ?

Not yet. Gimme a minute.
