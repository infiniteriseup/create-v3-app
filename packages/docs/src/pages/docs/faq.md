## FAQ

### Can you add tailwind though ? Pretty please ?

ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

### Can you add x, y, or z ?

The setup will be more complete in the _Enterprise Edition UltraDeluxeâ„¢_ version. What exactly will be in here is absolutely not set in stone at the moment. Discussions welcome!

I do however plan on adding a setup for testing in the "light weight" version. Testing is not optional and should be taken seriously in any sizeable application. "Buy safety nets, **AND** guard rails".

### Why can't I customize the CLI output like in the `create-t3-app` ?

Because I'm lazy. But it's on the roadmap !

### Why are those docs so bad ?

I am not a clever person.
